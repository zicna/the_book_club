This application is meant to be a place for users to add authors, books or categories,  and reviews about books. This way users can keep track of all books they read, find some new books for future reads based on other users' reviews, online resources about books or authors. All in all, it's meant to inspire us to enjoy reading books and learning new things about authors.
