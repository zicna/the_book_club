# ðŸ“š Book Store Project ðŸ“š
___


This application is meant to be a place for users to add authors, books or categories,  and reviews about books. This way users can keep track of all books they read, find some new books for future reads based on other users' reviews, online resources about books or authors. All in all, it's meant to inspire us to enjoy reading books and learning new things about authors.

After we are logged in we gain access to the _BOOKS_, _AUTHORS_, _CATEGORIES_. All these newly added pages have lists of respective entities and we can visit their show, edit, and new pages.
In the end, we have a PROFILE page of a current user where all activities will be shown.
